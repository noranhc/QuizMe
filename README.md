## Quiz Me

### Summary

Welcome to Quiz Me!

Quiz Me is a simple web app that allows users to pick a category and take a 10 question quiz to test their knowledge. 
It's built on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. A score is displayed throughout, and at the end the user is given a
 list of feedback including their incorrect questions. All quiz questions come from Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB.com).

You can access the project [here](https://noranhc.github.io/QuizMe/)!

- Allowing repeated play in a single session to compare legacy results
- Refactor script.js into different JS files for better code readability
- Improve UI and general appearance
- Implement a hint function
