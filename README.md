## Quiz Me

Quiz Me is a simple web app that allows users to pick a category and take a 10 question quiz to test their knowledge. It's built on
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. A score is displayed throughout, and at the end the user is given a list of their incorrect
questions. All quiz questions come from Open Trivia Database (opentdb.com).
